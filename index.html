                    Mr. Robot is the co-founder and leader of the hacker group fsociety,
                    a revolutionary prophet who plans to bring down the world's largest
                    conglomerate. Though he is intelligent and charismatic, Mr. Robot is
                    also emotionally manipulative, and can be quick to turn violent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It eventually becomes clear that Mr. Robot is a construct within
                    Elliot Alderson's mind. (“eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt”) His persona is an
                    idealized representation of Elliot's deceased father, Edward; where
                    Edward was unwilling or unable to take action, Mr. Robot was created
                    to inspire war against E Corp and incite historical change. In some
                    situations, Mr. Robot will take control and act through Elliot, thus
                    explaining his direct interactions with other people.

                    <h2>Elliot Anderson</h2>
                    <p>
                        Elliot Alderson is a former cybersecurity engineer of Allsafe
                        Cybersecurity and a member of fsociety. He is played by Rami
                        Malek.Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical
                        depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed
                        via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his
                        opinions of the people he encounters and the activity around him.
                        These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us
                        interpret Elliot's world, but given his mental illness, he is an
                        unreliable narrator, leaving us unsure whether what he tells us
                        we're seeing is actually what is happening. Typical of this is
                        when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil
                        Corp, reflecting his own opinion of the conglomerate.
